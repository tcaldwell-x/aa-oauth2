# Trigger Deployment Test

This file is created to test if Vercel is properly triggering deployments on new commits.

## Current Status

- Latest commit: d84f300
- Build configuration: Fixed npm/Yarn issue
- Expected: New deployment should trigger

## Test Steps

1. Commit this file
2. Push to GitHub
3. Check Vercel dashboard for new deployment
4. Verify build logs

## Troubleshooting

If deployment doesn't trigger:

1. Check Vercel project settings
2. Verify GitHub integration
3. Check webhook configuration
4. Try manual deployment

## Expected Results

- New deployment should start automatically
- Build should use npm instead of Yarn
- All API endpoints should work after deployment
